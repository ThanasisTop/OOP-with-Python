# OOP-with-Python
Virtual Eshop using OOP with Python

I was asked to design and implement a small application for an e-shop that sells the following
products PC Towers, PC Screens, Personal Computers and Workstations.

The PC Tower has 2 attributes:
• Memory Size in GB
• CPU Frequency in GHz

The PC screen is measured in inches. 

The Personal Computer is composed by
• 1 PC Tower,
• 1 PC screen
• 1 Hard Disk Drive (measured in GB) – It should be noted that the hard disk drive is not sold
separately.

The Workstation is composed by a Personal Computer as well as an Operating System (Windows or
Linux) – The operating system is not sold separately. 

Following the user’s choice, the application must then display the components and attributes of the
chosen product, and the user must be able to enter the respective data for its components and
attributes (e.g., Memory Size and CPU Frequency if a PC Tower is selected). The data input in all fields
/ attributes is mandatory and only numeric values should be allowed.
